Conditionals
- in python, if statment is how you perform this sort of decision-making.


-if statement
    if<expr>:
        <statement>
    
    #here if<expr> is an expression evaluated in a boolean context,
            <statement> is a valid python statement, which must be indented.
        Note: here the colon(:) following<expr> is a must requried.
